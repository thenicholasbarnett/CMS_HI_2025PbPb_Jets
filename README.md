This repository includes various scripts used to generate checks on jet performance in PbPb and low pileup pp collisions, as well as high level jet trigger efficiencies. 
These scripts are particularly used to generate plots shown at run preparation meetings in the heavy ion physics analysis group for the compact muon solenoid leading up to and during the heavy ion run in 2025.
