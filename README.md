This repository includes various scripts and header files used to generate checks on jet performance in PbPb and low pileup pp collisions, as well as high level jet trigger efficiencies. 
These scripts are particularly used to generate plots shown at run preparation meetings in the heavy ion physics analysis group for the compact muon solenoid leading up to and during the heavy ion run in 2025.

Also in this repository are files used to reconstruct data stored as streamer files, including bash scripts used to generate crab configurations files.
Bash scripts used generate condor jobs are present in this repository as well. These bash scripts for condor specifically work for scripts runnable in root that have two arguments, the first being an input file and the second being an output file.

In the executable files folder there are directories for high level trigger and object performance studies as well as one for reconstructing streamer files.
Many of these executable files include various headers that are also available in this repository.

This repository is a work in progress! If there are any discontinuities in files, such as headers used in an executable that are not present in this repo, please contact me at nbarne21@uic.edu
